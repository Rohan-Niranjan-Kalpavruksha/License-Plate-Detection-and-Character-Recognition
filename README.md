License Plate Detection and Character Recognition

The motto behind the project is detecting the cars number plate automatically and provide them with pay-slip and then open the road for that particular car. Parking authorities also use this system for allowing the vehicle to park in their area. In this system, firstly we capture the image of number plate then process it and read each and every character present in the number plate for their perfect recognition. The most significant phase is OCR, where the letterings on the image of number plate are changed into the texts which can be decoded later

Number Plate Recognition system is a security system. Image processing concept is used in Number Plate Recognition system. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scheme is also applied in this for reading the image of vehicle number plate.In India, the number plate containing white background with black foreground color is used for private cars and for the commercial vehicles yellow is used as background and black as foreground color.
